# Student Digital Twin System

The system focuses on explainability rather than complex machine learning models.
## Problem Statement
Traditional academic systems focus on past performance such as marks and attendance.
They fail to show how daily habits affect future academic and career outcomes.

## Proposed Solution
This project models a student as a digital twin and simulates academic progress
over time using habit-based inputs and time-lag logic.

## Core Idea: Student Digital Twin
A digital twin is a virtual representation of a student that captures academic
and behavioral data such as attendance, study hours, sleep, and skill development.

## System Architecture
1. Student data is captured as a digital twin
2. Academic logic evaluates the impact of habits
3. A time-lag simulation models progress over weeks
4. Career analytics estimate readiness and placement probability

## Current Status
- Core academic and career simulation implemented
- Backend modularized with clear separation from frontend
- Personalized study and career recommendations added
- Frontend development in progress (Streamlit-based UI)
## Development Notes
- Backend and frontend are developed on separate branches
- Backend focuses on simulation and analytics
- Frontend focuses on visualization and user interaction
